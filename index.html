          - As a user I want to be able to view all my todos in the same place,
          to get a good overview of what I have to do.

        <li>
          - As user I want to be able to add new todos to my todo list so I can
          update my todo list when I find something else that I need to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          - As a user I want to mark a todo as completed so I can see which
          todos I have left to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          - As a user I want to remove a todo from the list so I can keep my
          list as clean and short as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          - As a user I want to be able to move todos up and down in order to
          prioritize what I have to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          - As a user I want everything on my todo list on the same page because
          I don't want to navigate between pages and to get a good overview of
          everything. Bonus User Stories _(not mandatory, but might give you a
          good challenge)_
        </li>
        <li>
          - As a user I want to be able to put my name _(author of a todo)_ on a
          todo, so everyone in my family can add their own todos to the todo
          list.
        </li>
        <li>
          - As a user I want to be able to edit existing todos in case I
          remember something that has to do with a specific todo.
        </li>
        <li>
          - As a user I want a timestamp to be added to my new todos in order
          better se how old all the todos are.
        </li>
        <li>
          - As a user I want to be able to sort my todos after either timestamp
          or author.
